Design Notes

────────────────
Request-form
- Native browser select styling limits acknowledged
- Funnel icon switched from Unicode to SVG (no Unicode funnel exists)
- Table sorting behavior aligned with spreadsheet mental model

────────────────
Rule-form
- Categories introduced (shift / day / week / special)
- Animations used to clarify relationships, not decoration
- Wizard color semantics must never lie (green == complete only)

────────────────
Calendar
- Empty shift text standardized: “nobody is working / missing”
- Warnings must be visible at calendar level (explainability)

────────────────
Admin-tools
- Emoji select confusion caused by pooled/unpooled mental model
- Left/right click distinction unclear → must be explicit or removed

────────────────
General UX Principles
- Save buttons must reflect dirty state truthfully
- Autosave must never trigger without visible intent
- Visual polish is used to increase trust, not aesthetics
