🧠 Solver To-Do List (v0 – Working Backbone)
1. Demand Object Builder
1.1 ✔️ Initialize empty demand for all roles  { roleID: { min: 0, max: Infinity } }
1.2 ✔️ Loop through total rules - Shrink demand ranges (min/max intersection)
1.3 🟠 Loop through flexible rules - Compute derived min/max from current attendance - Shrink demand ranges again
1.4 ☐ Result: one final demand object per timeframe

2. Attendance Helpers
2.5 ✔️ Function to compute total per role, total = main + secondary + trinary
2.6 ✔️ Utility to clone attendance (for simulation) 
2.7 🟠 Utility to apply / revert a reassignment

3. Feasibility Check (Hard Gate)
3.8 ✔️ For each role: Check if attendance.total can reach demand.min - Include potential reassignable employees
3.9 ☐ If any role fails → mark timeframe as impossible, stop solver

4. Role Status Classification
4.10 ☐ For each role: deficit = demand.min - total / surplus = total - demand.max
4.11 ☐ Sort roles by: deficit first / larger absolute violation / rule priority (totals > ratios)

5. Reassignment Candidate Finder
5.12 ☐ Given a target role: Find employees in this timeframe / Filter by allowed roles (main → secondary → trinary)
5.13 ☐ Exclude moves that: Break any role below demand.min / Exceed demand.max
5.14 ☐ Rank candidates by: preference level / moving from surplus role /minimal disruption

6. Simulation Loop (Day / Shift)
6.15 ☐ While deficits exist: Pick highest-priority role / Simulate best reassignment
6.16 ☐ After simulation: Recompute attendance / Rebuild flexible demand / Validate all roles against demand ranges
6.17 ☐ Commit move only if valid
6.18 ☐ Stop when no improving move exists

7. Stop Conditions & Safety Nets
7.19 ☐ Max moves per timeframe
7.20 ☐ Max moves per employee
7.21 ☐ Detect no-op loops

8. Timeframe Strategy
8.22 ☐ Shift-level → solve + reassign
8.23 ☐ Day-level → solve + reassign (primary path)
8.24 ☐ Week-level → aggregate + warn only
8.25 ☐ No upward reassignment

9. Diagnostics & Debugging
9.26 ☐ Log demand before/after solving
9.27 ☐ Log every committed reassignment
9.28 ☐ Clear reason when solver stops (solved / stuck / impossible)

10. Beta Scope Guardrails
10.29 ☐ Ignore special rules
10.30 ☐ Fixed role range (0–13)
10.31 ☐ No cross-day employee moves

Detailed Summary of the Solver Approach
1. Key Components

Calendar

Knows scheduled employees per shift.

Builds the attendance object, which counts preferred, secondary, and emergency roles per shift.

Checker

Evaluates the attendance object against staffing requirements.

Generates warnings for understaffed or overstaffed roles.

Solver

Receives attendance and warnings.

Uses a needed roles object instead of individual rules:

hardNeeded → absolute minimum per role (cannot be violated)

softNeeded → target counts or ratios (preferred, but flexible)

Determines if a reassignment is possible and safe before committing.

2. Solver Strategy

Feasibility Check

Compare current attendance to hardNeeded.

If any hard-needed role cannot be filled with available employees → skip solving for this shift.

Priority-Based Reassignment

Handle understaffed roles first.

Use employee flexibility: preferred → secondary → emergency.

Respect hard constraints (never break hardNeeded) and try to improve soft constraints (softNeeded).

Iterative Shift-Level Solving

Treat each shift as an independent unit.

For each shift:

Simulate potential reassignment(s).

Recompute attendance and check against needed objects.

Commit reassignment only if it respects hardNeeded.

Stop once all roles are within tolerance or no further safe moves are possible.

Propagation

Higher levels (day/week) simply aggregate shift results.

Avoid reassigning at day/week level to prevent circular dependencies.

Ranking & Limits

Rules ranked by priority: totals before ratios.

Optional limits on employee moves per day to prevent ping-pong reassignments.
